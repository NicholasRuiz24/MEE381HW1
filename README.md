# MEE381 HW 1

**Program Function**

This program was made to record and print out the time of how long it takes to run certain mathematical operations using certain functions. 
THe program will see how long it takes to run double integer multiplication and addition as well as how long it takes to run double multiplication and addition. The program will aslo see how long it takes to run exponential power through self multiplication and through
using math.pow and how long it takes to caculate nath.sqrt

**Results**

After running the program a few times it can be seen that mupltication of both integers and doubles both takes longer compared to just doing addition.
It should also be noted that while multiplication for both integers and doubles took roughly the same amount of time, addition of integers was noticeably faster compared to doubles.
When calculating the square of numbers it was seen that by multplying by itself was much faster than using the math.pow function. However, using the math.sqrt function was not significantly lengthy in how long it took to caclulate.
